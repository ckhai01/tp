# User Guide

**GreyBook** is a desktop application that helps **NUS clubs and societies efficiently manage contacts and track attendance**. It combines the speed and precision of a Command Line Interface (CLI) with the convenience of a Graphical User Interface (GUI).

Optimized for users who prefer typing commands, GreyBook enables fast, streamlined management — letting you accomplish more in less time than with traditional GUI-based applications.

<box type="tip" seamless>

**New to a CLI?** It simply means typing short commands (like `add` or `list`) instead of clicking through menus and buttons. No need to use a mouse!

2. **Download GreyBook**

   Download the latest `.jar` file from the [Releases Page](https://github.com/AY2526S1-CS2103T-F13-4/tp/releases).<br>
   ![Where to download](images/githubDownload.png)<br>
   By default, this will download `greybook.jar` to your **Downloads** folder. This will be your **home folder**, or in other words, where your GreyBook data is stored.<br>
   If you wish, you can copy or move `greybook.jar` anywhere you like to change its **home folder**.


3. **Launch the Application**

   If you did not move `greybook.jar`, it will be in your **Downloads** folder. Navigate (`cd`) to it by running the following commands in your terminal:<br>

   ```
   cd Downloads
   java -jar greybook.jar
   ```
   **Note**: These are two separate commands! Press enter after each line to run them individually.<br>
   If you had moved `greybook.jar` elsewhere, replace `Downloads` with `greybook.jar`'s new filepath.

   > **macOS users:** If you see a security prompt the first time, right-click the `.jar` → **Open** → confirm.

4. **First Look**

   GreyBook should launch within a few seconds.
   A few sample students are preloaded so you can try out basic commands immediately.

   ```

2. **Mark John's Attendance as Present**

   ```
   mark A0000000Y p/
   ```

3. **Unmark John's Attendance**

   ```
   unmark A0000000Y
   ```

4. **Find and Display John**

   ```
   find i/A0000000Y
   ```
5. **List All Students**
    ```
    list
    ```

## Command Format Summary

Here is some important information you need to understand the rest of the guide!

**Quick Notes about the command format:**

- Words in `UPPER_CASE` are called **parameters**, things you replace.<br>
  e.g. in `add n/NAME`, replace `NAME` with a student's name, like `add n/John Doe`.

- Items in square brackets are optional.<br>
  e.g. `n/NAME [t/TAG]` can be used as `n/John Doe t/member` or as `n/John Doe`.

- Items in round brackets are mutually exclusive. Pick only one!<br>
  e.g. `(INDEX | STUDENTID)` can be used as `1` or as `A0000000Y`.

- Items with `…`​ after them can be used multiple times, including zero times.<br>
  e.g. `[t/TAG]…​` can be used as ` ` (0 times), `t/member` (1 time), `t/member t/exco` (2 times) etc.

- If you are using a PDF version of this document, be careful when copying and pasting commands that span multiple lines,type them out manually instead!

## Core Features

![help message](images/helpMessage.png)

---

#### Exiting the Application: `exit`

**Command:** `exit`

Closes GreyBook.

---

### Miscellaneous Features

#### Terminal-like Behaviour

Want to rerun a command you typed before? Similar to a typical CLI application, use the **up or down arrows** to navigate your command history. You can also use Ctrl+C to clear the current command!

<box type="tip" seamless>

**Tip:** If you have selected some text in the command, `Ctrl+C` will not clear your command. This way, you can still use `Ctrl+C` to copy the text!
</box>

<box type="warning" seamless>

**Caution! For advanced users**
The command history is saved in the hard disk automatically after every successful command as a JSON file at: `[JAR file location]/history.json`. 
It is not recommended to modify this file to alter your command history. If your changes to the history file makes it invalid, GreyBook will discard all history and start fresh on the next run. Before you edit, make a backup copy of the file.
</box>

---

#### Automatic Saving of Data

GreyBook data is saved in the hard disk automatically after any command that changes the data. There is no need to save manually.

The data is saved as a JSON file at: <br>
`[JAR file location]/data/greybook.json` <br>

By default, your data file is located at: <br>
`Downloads/data/greybook.json`<br>
Open the Downloads folder in your preferred File Explorer to check it out!

<box type="warning" seamless>

**Caution!**
Editing this file is recommended for advanced users only. If your changes to the data file makes it invalid, GreyBook will discard all data and start fresh on the next run. Before you edit, make a backup copy of the file.
Some changes can cause the GreyBook to behave in unexpected ways (e.g., if a value entered is outside the acceptable range). Therefore, edit the data file only if you are confident that you can update it correctly.
</box>

## Recommended Workflows (for experienced users)

Here are some unique ways to combine commands to increase your efficiency with GreyBook. <br>

Scenario 1: I know the expected headcount and one person is excused. My on-site count matches that.<br>
Recommended Flow: `mark` all students as present, `find` the excused student and `mark` accordingly. <br>
```
mark all p/
find Jason
mark 1 e/
list
```

Scenario 2: I have late arrivals that I need to mark.<br>
Recommended Flow: `find` the late arrivals and `mark all l/`. No need to look for latecomers manually! <br>
```
find jack jill
mark all l/
list
```

Scenario 3: Students are trickling in and I need to mark them as present one by one.<br>
Recommended Flow: Type a `find` command followed by student names as they arrive. When you have the time, execute the `find` command and `mark all p/` to mark those that arrived so far.<br>
```
find john sally jason maria
mark all p/
list
find tommy larry
...
```

## Full Command Format Details

For advanced users who wish to use special characters like quotation marks (`"`) in your arguments, do take note of these advanced command formats.

**Notes about the command format:**

- Parameters can be in any order.<br>
  e.g. if the command specifies `n/NAME p/PHONE_NUMBER`, `p/PHONE_NUMBER n/NAME` is also acceptable.

- Extra parameters for commands that do not take in parameters (such as `help`, `list`, `exit` and `clear`) will be ignored.<br>
  e.g. if the command specifies `help 123`, it will be interpreted as `help`.

- If a prefix for the command occurs in the argument, you may use quotation marks `"` to escape it.
  e.g. `SomeCommandName p/"p-Slash t/ contains t-Slash" t/tag`

- If you want to use quotation marks `"` in your argument, you have to escape it with a backslash `\`
  e.g. `SomeCommandName t/Quote: \"`

- Likewise, if you wanted to use backslashes `\` in your argument, you have to escape it with a backslash.
  e.g. `SomeCommandName t/Backslash: \\`

## FAQs

### Installation & Requirements

**Q: What operating systems does GreyBook support?**<br>
**A:** Any system that can run Java 17+ (Windows, macOS, Linux). If Java runs, GreyBook runs.

**Q: Do I need to install anything besides GreyBook?**<br>
**A:** Yes, **Java 17 or newer**. Check with `java -version`. If it's older, install a current Long Term Support Java version.

### Updating & Migration

**Q: How do I update GreyBook to a new version?**<br>
**A:** Download the new `.jar` and run it. Your existing data in `data/greybook.json` will be picked up automatically if you keep it in the same folder.

**Q: Will I lose my data when I update?**<br>
**A:** No. The data file is separate from the app. Keep `data/greybook.json` with the `.jar` and you're good.

**Q: Can I move GreyBook to another computer (or a USB drive)?**<br>
**A:** Yes. Copy the `.jar` **and** the `data` folder together, as well the config and preferences files, `config.json` and `preferences.json` respectively. If you would to copy the command history as well, copy over the file `history.json`. On the new computer, double-click the `.jar`.

### Data Location, Saving & Backup

**Q: Where exactly is my data?**<br>
**A:** In `[JAR file location]/data/greybook.json`. By default, it will be in `Downloads/data/greybook.json`

**Q: Does GreyBook save automatically?**<br>
**A:** Yes. Changes are saved to `greybook.json` right after each command.

**Q: How do I back up my data?**<br>
**A:** Close GreyBook and copy `data/greybook.json` to a safe place (cloud/storage drive).

**Q: I edited the JSON and something broke. What now?**<br>
**A:** Close GreyBook, restore your backup `greybook.json`, then reopen GreyBook. Avoid manual edits unless you're confident.

**Q: How do I reset GreyBook to factory data?**<br>
**A:** Close the app, delete `data/greybook.json`, and reopen GreyBook (you'll start fresh with sample data).

### Search Behaviour

**Q: Are name searches case-sensitive?**<br>
**A:** No. `hans` matches `Hans`.

**Q: Why doesn't `find Han` match `Hans`?**<br>
**A:** `find` matches **full words**. Use the full word or multiple keywords.

**Q: How do tags work?**<br>
**A:** Add any number: `t/member t/colleague`. Editing tags **replaces** the old set. Use `t/` (empty) to clear all tags.

### Limits & Performance

**Q: Is there an undo command?**<br>
**A:** Not currently. Actions like `delete` and `clear` are immediate and irreversible. Consider regular backups of `data/greybook.json`.

**Q: Can I store addresses or other fields?**<br>
**A:** Only the fields shown in the command formats are supported (e.g., `n/`, `p/`, `e/`, `i/`, and tags).

**Q: How many students can I store?**<br>
**A:** There's no hard limit in the app; performance depends on your computer.

### Name Related Issues

**Q: What characters are allowed in the name field?**<br>
**A:** Only alphabets and the following special characters are allowed: `(Empty space)`, `,`, `(`, `)`, `/`, `.`, `@`, `-`, `'`.

**Q: My name contains a character that is not allowed in the name. How should I enter my name?**<br>
**A:** Please use standard English (Latin) letters only.
For example, if your name is "محمد", you can enter it as "Mohamed". If your name is "李华", you can enter it as "Li Hua".
Similarly, if your name contains special characters such as accents or diacritics (e.g. "José", "Strauß"), please remove them — e.g. "Jose", "Straus".

**Q: Why are some special characters allowed but not others?**<br>
**A:** This is due to the limitation of the program, as we are unable to support every single possible unicode character. We defer this decision to [Singapore's Myinfo](https://partnersupport.singpass.gov.sg/hc/en-sg/articles/32733563138585-What-are-the-special-characters-allowed-in-Myinfo-Name-data-item) for supported special characters.
