# GreyBook User Guide

GreyBook is a **desktop app for managing contacts, optimised for use via a Command Line Interface** (CLI) while still having the benefits of a Graphical User Interface (GUI). If you can type fast, GreyBook can get your contact management tasks done faster than traditional GUI apps.

> New to a CLI? It just means that you type short commands (like 'add' or 'list') instead of clicking through menus on a GUI.

## Quick start

1. **Install Java 17 or newer.**
   - Check your version: open a terminal (Windows: Command Prompt; macOS/Linux: Terminal) and run `java -version`.
   - If you don’t have Java 17+, install the latest Long Term Support (LTS) Java. macOS users can follow this guide: <https://se-education.org/guides/tutorials/javaInstallationMac.html>.

2. **Download GreyBook.**
   - Get the latest `.jar` from the [Releases page](https://github.com/AY2526S1-CS2103T-F13-4/tp/releases).
   - Save it to a folder you’ll remember (this becomes GreyBook’s “home” folder).

3. **Start the app.**
   - In a terminal, run the command `cd` with the GreyBook's "Home" folder, and run GreyBook with Java:
     ```
     cd C:\Users\John\GreyBookFolder
     java -jar GreyBook.jar
     ```

4. **What you’ll see.**
   - A window opens with sample contacts so you can try commands.

5. **Try a few commands:**
    - `help` — open the help window
    - `add n/John Doe p/98765432 e/johnd@example.com i/A0000000Y` — add a person
    - `mark 1 p/` — marks the attendance of the 1st person in the list as `Present`
    - `mark A0000000Y a/` — marks John Doe as `Absent`
    - `unmark 1` — remove the attendance status of the 1st person in the list
    - `unmark A0000000Y` — removes the attendance status of John Doe
    - `unmark all` — removes the attendance status of all people
    - `list` — show all people
    - `delete 3` — delete the 3rd person in the list
    - `clear` — delete all people
    - `exit` — quit the app

> If you see a security prompt on macOS the first time you open the app, right-click the `.jar` and choose **Open**, then confirm.

## Features

<box type="info" seamless>

**Notes about the command format:**<br>

- Words in `UPPER_CASE` are called **parameters**, things you replace.<br>
  e.g. in `add n/NAME`, replace `NAME` with a person's name, like `add n/John Doe`.

- Items in square brackets are optional.<br>
  e.g. `n/NAME [t/TAG]` can be used as `n/John Doe t/friend` or as `n/John Doe`.

- Items with `…`​ after them can be used multiple times, including zero times.<br>
  e.g. `[t/TAG]…​` can be used as ` ` (0 times), `t/friend` (1 time), `t/friend t/family` (2 times) etc.

- Parameters can be in any order.<br>
  e.g. if the command specifies `n/NAME p/PHONE_NUMBER`, `p/PHONE_NUMBER n/NAME` is also acceptable.

- Extra parameters for commands that do not take in parameters (such as `help`, `list`, `exit` and `clear`) will be ignored.<br>
  e.g. if the command specifies `help 123`, it will be interpreted as `help`.

- If a prefix for the command occurs in the argument, you may use quotation marks `"` to escape it.
  e.g. `SomeCommandName p/"p-Slash t/ contains t-Slash" t/tag`

* If you want to use quotation marks `"` in your argument, you have to escape it with a backslash `\`
  e.g. `SomeCommandName t/Quote: \"`

* Likewise if you wanted to use backslashes `\` in your argument, you have to escape it with a backslash.
  e.g. `SomeCommandName t/Backslash: \\`

- If you are using a PDF version of this document, be careful when copying and pasting commands that span multiple lines as space characters surrounding line-breaks may be omitted when copied over to the application. Type them out manually instead!

### Saving the data

### Editing the data file

GreyBook data is saved automatically as a JSON file at: <br>
`[JAR file location]/data/GreyBook.json`

<box type="warning" seamless>
**Caution!**
Editing this file is recommended for advanced users only. If your changes to the data file makes it invalid, GreyBook will discard all data and start fresh on the next run. Before you edit, make a backup copy of the file.
Some changes can cause the GreyBook to behave in unexpected ways (e.g., if a value entered is outside the acceptable range). Therefore, edit the data file only if you are confident that you can update it correctly.

## FAQs

**Q: What operating systems does GreyBook support?**
**A:** Any system that can run Java 17+ (Windows, macOS, Linux). If Java runs, GreyBook runs.

**Q: Do I need to install anything besides GreyBook?**
**A:** Yes, **Java 17 or newer**. Check with `java -version`. If it’s older, install a current Long Term Support Java version.

**Q: How do I update GreyBook to a new version?**
**A:** Download the new `.jar` and run it. Your existing data in `data/GreyBook.json` will be picked up automatically if you keep it in the same folder.

**Q: Will I lose my data when I update?**
**A:** No. The data file is separate from the app. Keep `data/GreyBook.json` with the `.jar` and you’re good.

**Q: Where exactly is my data?**
**A:** In `[JAR file location]/data/GreyBook.json`.

**Q: Can I move GreyBook to another computer (or a USB drive)?**
**A:** Yes. Copy the `.jar` **and** the `data` folder together. On the new computer, double-click the `.jar`.

**Q: Is there an undo command?**
